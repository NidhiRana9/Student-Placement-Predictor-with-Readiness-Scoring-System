🎓 Student Placement Prophet - ML-Based Placement Prediction System
📌 Overview
Student Placement Prophet is a machine learning-powered web application designed to predict the likelihood of a student securing a job through campus placements. It analyzes a mix of academic, technical, and behavioral parameters to provide accurate placement forecasts and improvement insights.

The project combines multiple classification algorithms with a clean Streamlit interface, enabling students and academic institutions to make data-driven decisions about employability and placement preparedness.

🚀 Features
✅ Predicts whether a student is likely to get placed or not.

📊 Generates a Placement Readiness Score (0–100).

🧠 Trained on models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

📈 Evaluates models based on accuracy and performance.

💡 Provides personalized suggestions for profile improvement.

🌐 Interactive and easy-to-use Streamlit web interface.
